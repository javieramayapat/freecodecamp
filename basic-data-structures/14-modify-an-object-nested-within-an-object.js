/**
 * ðŸ“‘ Notes:

 * ðŸ¤¯ Now let's take a look at a slightly more complex object. 
 * Object properties can be nested to an arbitrary depth, 
 * and their values can be any type of data supported by JavaScript, 
 * including arrays and even other objects.
 * 
 * âœ¨ We use dot notation to move beetween leves of the object and reference the property.
 * 
 * ðŸ§  Excercise:
 * 
 * Here we've defined an object userActivity, which includes another object nested within it. 
 * Set the value of the online key to 45.

/**
 * ðŸ“‘ Notes:
 * 
 * âœ¨ pop() removes an element from the end of an array
 * âœ¨ shift() removes an element from the beginning
 * 
 * ðŸ‘€ The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), 
 * is that neither method takes parameters, 
 * and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.
 * 
 * ðŸ¤¯ We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:
 * let deleteGreeting = greetings.pop();
 * 
 * ðŸ§  Challenge:
 * 
 * We have defined a function, popShift, which takes an array as an argument and returns a new array. 
 * Modify the function, using pop() and shift(), to remove the first and last elements of the argument array, 
 * and assign the removed elements to their corresponding variables, so that the returned array contains their values.
